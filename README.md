# RimuEirnarn's (sanitized) dotfiles

You can clone or want me to use some scripts you own. Pull it in if you have one.

## Installation

you can run `install.sh`

It's should build some directory for you. It's very alike with what linux have in common.

**NOTE**: There's some _fishy_ files here, though mostly scripts, some are weird one. Just like what i said
